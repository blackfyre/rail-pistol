# Rail Pistol

This is the source code for my [Pistol Railgun](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4700343) Remix.  
The code is for an Arduino nano, but there's nothing platform specific. You can just as well use an ESP8266/ESP32/... anything that fits into the housing.

You can use a PlatformIO IDE to compile the project.
